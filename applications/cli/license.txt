the same degree of care that you use to protect your own confidential information, but in no event less than a

restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement. You will be fully responsible for any confidentiality breach by your
employees. You must not disclose the terms or existence of this Agreement, and must not use Intel's name in any

INCLUDING THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL

on Your behalf violates any of its terms or conditions. Upon termination, You will immediately destroy and ensure the
destruction of the access credentials to the Pre-Release Software and, upon request, provide certification of such
destruction to Intel. All licenses granted to You hereunder terminate immediately upon termination of the Agreement. All
but Section 2 of this Agreement will survive termination.

14. Governing Law. Jurisdiction. Injunctive Relief. This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relating to it will
be governed by the laws of the U.S.A. and the state of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The
Parties exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
(1980). The state and federal courts sitting in Delaware, U.S.A. will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts. A
Party that obtains a judgment against the other Party in the courts identified in this section may enforce that judgment
in any court having jurisdiction over the Parties. You acknowledge that any disclosure, commercialization, or public use
of the Pre-Release Software or any portion thereof in violation of this Agreement would cause irreparable injury to
Intel and You consent to the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of such a
threatened or actual breach.

15. Export Regulations. Export Control. You agree that neither You nor Your subsidiaries will export/re-export the Pre-
Release Software, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other agency

other governmental approval, without first obtaining any required license or approval. In the event the Pre-Release
Software are exported from the U.S. or re-exported from a foreign jurisdiction by You or Your subsidiary, You will

government.

16. Government Restricted Rights. The Pre-Release Software may include commercial items (as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101)
or commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation (as those terms are used in 48 C.F.R.
12.212). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, You will not provide the

express prior written consent, will be null and void. Intel may assign, delegate and transfer this Agreement, and its
rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.

18. Entire Agreement. Severability. The terms and conditions of this Agreement and any NDA between You and Intel
constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merge and supersede
all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions. Neither Party will be bound by
any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or representations with respect to the subject matter
hereof other than as expressly provided herein. If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable or invalid
under any applicable law or applicable court decision, such finding will not render this Agreement unenforceable or
invalid as a whole, instead such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of
such provision within legal limits.

19. Waiver. The failure of a Party to require performance by the other Party of any provision hereof will not affect the
full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will waiver by a Party of a breach of any provision
hereof constitute a waiver of the provision itself.
