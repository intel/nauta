# Product Overview

Nauta software provides a multi-user, distributed computing environment for running deep learning model training experiments.
 Results of experiments, can be viewed and monitored using a command line interface, web UI and/or TensorBoard. You can
 use existing data sets, use your own data, or downloaded data from online sources, and create public or private folders
 to make collaboration amongst teams easier. Nauta runs using the industry leading Kubernetes and Docker platform
 for scalability and ease of management. Templates are available (and customizable) on the platform to take the
 complexities out of creating and running single and multi-node deep learning training experiments without all the systems
 overhead and scripting needed with standard container environments. To test your model, Nauta also supports both batch
 and streaming inference, all in a single platform.

The Nauta client software has been validated on the following operating systems and versions:

* Ubuntu* (16.04, 18.04)
* RedHat* 7.5
* macOS* High Sierra (10.13)
* Windows* 10
